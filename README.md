## Partial Differential Equation Solver

First we have implementations for the heat equation in 1D and 2D using the finite difference method and explicit Euler time stepping. The implementations are found in heat-eqn-1d.py and heat_eqn_2d.py

We also use implement the Implicit and Explicit Closest Point Methods from Macdonald and Ruuth's paper https://steveruuth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/icpm.pdf
We utilize the method to solve the 2d heat equation, the shifted Poisson equation, and the regular Poisson equation (see files in CPM)
