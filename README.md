## Partial Differential Equation Solver

First we have implementations for the heat equation in 1D and 2D using the finite difference method and explicit Euler time stepping. The implementations are found in heat-eqn-1d.py and heat_eqn_2d.py

We also use the Explicit Closest Point Method to solve the heat equation on the unit circle in 2D (based off of Macdonald and Ruuth's paper https://steveruuth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/icpm.pdf). The implementation is in cpm_heatEquation2D.py
