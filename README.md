## pde-solver

heat-eqn-1d.py solves the heat equation on a 1D interval using the finite difference method and explicit euler time stepping

heat_eqn_2d.py similarly solves the heat equation on a 2D grid using the same approach. But in practice this approach is highly unstable (implicit method would be better)

TODO: add more methods (FEM, CPM, etc) and generalized problems (higher dimensions for example)
